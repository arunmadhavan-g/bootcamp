## Road to Mastery

### Right Mental Models
Given a problem statement, the learner should be able to come up with a good mental model. This mental model reflects in the DB design, in the abstractions created in the programming language, and in the overall design of the solution. 

### Tradeoffs
Every solution has tradeoffs, and likely works well with one set of constraints but doesn't work well with another set of constraints. Understand those tradeoffs.
